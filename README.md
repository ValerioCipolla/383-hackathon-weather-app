# Weather APP

We built this weather app in 4 hours, using the [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) during the 383 hackhaton.

The app is deployed on Netlify and you can visit the live site [here](https://6273d40840567e5083c3ab72--transcendent-meerkat-75dea9.netlify.app/) 

The app allows the user to input the name of a city and find out what the weather is like right now in that city!

We display basic information like temperature and weather but also more specific ones like the speed of the wind in real time and the time of sunset and sunrise.
